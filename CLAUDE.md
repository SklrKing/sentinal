# Microsoft Defender & Entra Security Agent - Claude Implementation

**Created:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Automated security monitoring and analysis for Jess Ford's Microsoft 365 environment  
**Agent Type:** Claude Code defensive security automation  

## Executive Summary

This Claude-powered security agent automates the daily and weekly security monitoring tasks outlined in `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`. It connects to Microsoft Defender and Entra ID (Azure AD) to analyze security alerts, sign-in patterns, and user behaviors, generating actionable intelligence while maintaining the human-in-the-loop principle defined in `AGENT.md`.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Automated analysis of Microsoft Defender security alerts
- Detection of suspicious sign-in patterns (brute force, password spray, impossible travel)  
- Risk assessment of users and devices
- Integration with existing security workflows via GitHub Issues and notifications
- Comprehensive reporting aligned with compliance requirements

## Business Value

### Time Savings
- **Daily Tasks:** Reduces 30-45 minutes of manual portal checking to 5-minute report review
- **Weekly Analysis:** Automates 2-3 hours of comprehensive security review into structured reports
- **Alert Triage:** Prioritizes critical issues, eliminating noise from low-priority alerts

### Risk Reduction
- **Early Detection:** Identifies threats within hours instead of days
- **Pattern Recognition:** Spots subtle attack patterns humans might miss
- **Consistency:** Never misses scheduled security checks due to human factors

### Compliance Support
- **Audit Trail:** All analyses are logged with timestamps and data sources
- **Documentation:** Automated generation of security posture reports
- **Trend Analysis:** Historical data supports compliance reviews and security assessments

Aligns with **SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md** daily requirements:

1. **Defender Portal Review** ‚Üí Agent analyzes last 24 hours of alerts
2. **Entra Risky Sign-ins** ‚Üí Agent identifies suspicious authentication attempts  
3. **Backup Status Check** ‚Üí Agent flags any critical alerts requiring immediate attention

**Output:** Daily security briefing with priority actions (5-minute human review)

### Weekly Workflow (Automated - Monday 9:00 AM)  
Aligns with **SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md** weekly requirements:

1. **Device Coverage Verification** ‚Üí Agent reports Defender EDR enrollment gaps
2. **Conditional Access Analysis** ‚Üí Agent identifies policy bypass attempts
3. **Guest User Review** ‚Üí Agent flags unusual external access patterns
4. **Phishing Awareness Data** ‚Üí Agent provides metrics for staff communications

**Output:** Comprehensive security posture report with strategic recommendations

### Critical Alert Response (Real-time)
When high-severity issues are detected:

1. **Immediate Assessment** ‚Üí Agent categorizes threat level and affected assets
2. **Automated Issue Creation** ‚Üí GitHub issue created with investigation checklist  
3. **Notification Dispatch** ‚Üí Slack/Teams alert sent to security team
4. **Context Assembly** ‚Üí Links to Azure portal with relevant search queries pre-built

## Detection Capabilities

### Sign-in Analysis

- **Password Spray Identification:** Multiple usernames from same IP  
- **Impossible Travel:** Geographically inconsistent sign-ins
- **Legacy Protocol Usage:** IMAP, POP3, SMTP authentication attempts
- **MFA Bypass Attempts:** Repeated MFA failures or suspicious approvals
- **Guest Account Anomalies:** Unusual access from external users

### Defender Alert Analysis  
- **Critical Alert Prioritization:** Ransomware, credential theft, lateral movement
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** Categorizes threats by attack framework
- **Asset Impact Assessment:** Identifies most-targeted devices and users
- **Trend Analysis:** Detects increasing threat volumes or new attack patterns
- **Incident Correlation:** Links related alerts into comprehensive threat stories

  "risk_threshold": "medium"
}
```

### Notification Settings

### Critical Alert Example
```markdown
üö® CRITICAL ALERT: Potential Credential Compromise

**User:** jsmith@company.com
**Alert:** Multiple failed sign-ins followed by successful authentication from new location
**Timeline:** 07:45-08:15 GMT  
**Risk Factors:**
- 12 failed attempts from 198.51.100.23 (Ukraine)
- Successful sign-in from 203.0.113.67 (Ukraine) 15 minutes later
- First sign-in from this country  
- Legacy Exchange ActiveSync protocol used

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Immediately reset user password and revoke sessions
2. Enable additional MFA requirements  
3. Review recent email/file access for signs of compromise
4. Block source IP addresses if not legitimate business need
```

## Compliance and Audit Support

### Audit Trail
- All API calls logged with timestamps
- Analysis parameters and thresholds recorded  
- Report generation tracked for compliance reviews
- Configuration changes version-controlled in Git

### Data Retention
- Reports: 30 days (configurable)
- Logs: 90 days for investigation support
- Raw data: Not stored locally (pulled fresh from Microsoft APIs)
- PII redaction: Configurable for sensitive environments

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues

**"Authentication Failed"**
- Check certificate hasn't expired
- Verify thumbprint matches Azure app registration  
- Confirm all API permissions granted with admin consent

**"No Data Returned"**  
- Verify Azure AD P1/P2 licensing for advanced sign-in logs
- Check Defender for Endpoint deployment status
- Confirm audit logs enabled in Azure AD settings

**"Permission Denied"**
- Wait 10 minutes for permission propagation after changes
- Verify app registration has correct Graph API permissions
- Test with PowerShell: `Get-MgSecurityAlert -Top 1`

### Performance Optimization
- API calls are rate-limited to avoid throttling
- Results cached for 15 minutes to improve response times
- Pagination handled automatically for large datasets
- Retry logic built-in for transient failures

## Security Considerations

### Read-Only Operations
- Agent has NO write permissions to any Microsoft services
- Cannot modify users, policies, or security settings
- Cannot delete or archive data
- Cannot respond to alerts automatically

### Data Security  
- Certificates stored in secure file system locations
- API responses logged without PII (when configured)
- Network traffic encrypted via HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- Local report files protected by OS file permissions

### Access Control
- Service account has minimum required permissions
- Certificate-based authentication preferred over secrets
- Regular permission audits via built-in permission testing
- Break-glass admin accounts excluded from automation

## Future Enhancements
