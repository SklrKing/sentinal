# Jess Ford Cybersecurity Plan (Summary)

## Immediate Priorities

-   **Enable MFA for all accounts** (highest ROI, blocks 99% of
    credential attacks).
-   **Ensure Defender EDR is deployed on all endpoints** and configure
    attack surface reduction rules.
-   **Backups:** Confirm OneDrive/SharePoint versioning is active; add
    3rd-party or immutable backups for safety.
-   **Awareness:** Launch phishing training and clear communication to
    staff.

## Short-Term (2--3 Months)

-   Configure **Conditional Access** policies (MFA on risky logins,
    block legacy auth).
-   Enforce **device hardening** (Controlled Folder Access, Tamper
    Protection).
-   Roll out **DLP policies** in Purview for sensitive info.
-   Secure **DealerTrack migration**: enforce MFA, decommission CDK
    accounts.

## Medium-Term (4--6 Months)

-   Deploy **DGX Spark** for AI-powered log analysis and automation.
-   Build an **internal GPT assistant** for users and IT scripting
    support.
-   Automate **on/off-boarding** with Power Automate/Intune.
-   Create **compliance dashboards** for Secure Score, patching, alerts.

## Long-Term (6+ Months)

-   Formalize and test an **Incident Response Plan**.
-   Expand AI assistant use cases (business data, SOPs).
-   Conduct **biannual recovery drills** (ransomware, account breach).
-   Ongoing **policy reviews, patching, and user feedback**.

**Guiding Principle:** Automate wherever possible, enforce least
privilege, and keep IT's focus on strategic projects rather than
firefighting.
